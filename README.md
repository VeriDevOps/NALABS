NALABS is composed of two main components: the GUI as the main program executable and the metrics used as proxy for bad smells. 

The latest release of the NALABS executable can be downloaded from GitHub on the releases page: https://github.com/eduardenoiu/nalabs_release Alternatively, it can be built from source code.
